## Problem Statement

Freelance designers often face challenges in pricing their work accurately, which can lead to inconsistent pricing and income loss over time. Without a structured approach, designers may undervalue their expertise or struggle to justify their rates to clients.

## Solution

AUREA is a web-based platform that provides an intelligent pricing calculator to determine fair hourly and project rates. It considers real business costs and integrates AI to streamline the entire pricing and invoicing workflow.

## Key Features

### Intelligent Pricing Calculator
Calculate fair rates based on your actual business costs:
- Expected annual salary
- Equipment and software costs
- Utilities and rent expenses
- Desired profit margin
- Available billable hours

### AI-Powered Brief Analysis
Upload project briefs (PDF) and let **Google Gemini AI** automatically extract:
- Project type and scope
- Estimated duration
- Quality requirements
- Deliverables and milestones

### Professional Invoice Generation
Generate polished, client-ready invoices with all project details automatically populated from your brief analysis.

### Public Portfolio Page
