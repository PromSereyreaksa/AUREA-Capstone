BRAND IDENTITY PROJECT BRIEF

From: TechVenture Co. (Early-stage startup)
To: Freelance Designer
Date: February 2026

PROJECT OVERVIEW
We're a tech startup launching in 3 weeks and need a complete brand identity ASAP! We're bootstrapped so budget is tight but we know good design matters.

ABOUT US
TechVenture is disrupting the e-commerce space with AI-powered recommendations. Founded 6 months ago, team of 4, raising seed round. Based in Phnom Penh but targeting Southeast Asian market.

WHAT WE NEED (URGENT!)
We literally have nothing right now and our investor pitch is in 3 weeks. Need everything:

1. Logo Design
   - Need primary logo and maybe a simplified version for app icon
   - Modern, tech-forward vibe
   - Works on both light and dark backgrounds

2. Color Palette
   Something that pops but still professional. Our competitors all use blue so maybe avoid that?

3. Typography
   Whatever fonts work best for tech/startup

4. Basic Brand Guidelines
   Just the essentials - we don't need a 50-page document. Logo usage, colors, fonts. That's it.

5. Social Media Assets
   We need profile pictures for LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram
   Maybe some post templates? If there's time?

6. Business Cards
   For the 4 founders. Simple design.

TIMELINE
This is URGENT - we have an investor meeting March 8th (3 weeks from now). Can you turn this around FAST? We're flexible on minor details if it means faster delivery.

BUDGET
We're a startup so funds are limited. We saw similar work online ranging from $500-2000. Hoping to stay around $1000 but can stretch a bit for the right designer. What can you do?

STYLE PREFERENCES
- Modern, minimal
- Tech-forward but not too geeky
- Professional but approachable
- Think: Stripe, Notion, Linear (that vibe)

DELIVERABLES FORMAT
Source files and exported PNGs/SVGs. We'll handle the rest.

REVISIONS
Probably need 2-3 rounds? We're pretty decisive but our CTO is picky.

IMPORTANT NOTES
- This is time-sensitive!!! 
- We're first-time founders so might need some guidance
- If you can start this week that would be amazing
- We're in Cambodia time zone for quick communication
