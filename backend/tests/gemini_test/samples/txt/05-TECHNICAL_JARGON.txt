TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION DOCUMENT
Distributed Microservices Architecture Implementation

PROJECT CODENAME: Project Nebula

TECHNICAL OVERVIEW:
We require the development of a cloud-native, containerized microservices architecture utilizing Kubernetes orchestration with Istio service mesh for inter-service communication. The system must implement event-driven architecture patterns using Apache Kafka for asynchronous message processing and maintain ACID compliance through distributed transaction management with the Saga pattern.

TECHNOLOGY STACK:
• Backend: Node.js (NestJS framework), Go (gRPC services)
• Frontend: React 18 with TypeScript, Next.js for SSR
• State Management: Redux Toolkit with RTK Query
• Database: PostgreSQL (primary), MongoDB (document store), Redis (caching layer)
• Message Queue: Apache Kafka with Schema Registry
• API Gateway: Kong with rate limiting and JWT authentication
• Container Orchestration: Kubernetes (EKS)
• Service Mesh: Istio for traffic management and observability
• CI/CD: GitHub Actions, ArgoCD for GitOps
• Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana, ELK stack for log aggregation
• Infrastructure as Code: Terraform, Helm charts

ARCHITECTURAL COMPONENTS:

1. API Gateway Layer
   - Kong API Gateway with OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect
   - Rate limiting (token bucket algorithm)
   - Request validation using JSON Schema
   - Circuit breaker pattern implementation

2. Service Layer (Microservices)
   - User Authentication Service (OAuth 2.0, JWT)
   - Authorization Service (RBAC + ABAC)
   - Payment Processing Service (PCI DSS compliant)
   - Notification Service (WebSocket + FCM)
   - Analytics Service (real-time data processing)
   - File Storage Service (S3-compatible object storage)
   - Search Service (Elasticsearch with custom analyzers)
   - Audit Logging Service (write-ahead logging)

3. Data Layer
   - CQRS pattern implementation
   - Event Sourcing for audit trail
   - Database sharding strategy (consistent hashing)
   - Read replicas for query optimization
   - Connection pooling (pgBouncer)

4. Infrastructure
   - Multi-region deployment (active-active)
   - Auto-scaling policies (HPA + VPA)
   - Blue-green deployment strategy
   - Disaster recovery (RTO: 1 hour, RPO: 15 minutes)
   - Backup strategy (incremental + full)
