Project Proposal

We need something for our company. It's kind of urgent but not too urgent. 

The thing we want is similar to what our competitor has but better. You know what I mean?

Scope:
Maybe a few pages or screens? Not sure exactly. Whatever makes sense.

Design:
Something modern but not too modern. Professional but friendly. Clean but not boring.

Features:
- The usual stuff
- Some interactive elements
- Whatever is trending now
- Integration with our systems (we'll figure out which ones later)

Timeline:
Soon as possible but we're flexible. Probably a couple weeks? Or months? Depends on the scope I guess.

Budget:
We have a budget but it's flexible depending on what we get.

Technical stuff:
Use whatever technology you think is best. We trust your judgment.

Deliverables:
Whatever files we need to launch this thing.

Notes:
We might change our minds about some details as we go. Hope that's okay.
