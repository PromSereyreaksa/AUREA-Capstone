Hey!
So we’re launching a new thing called “Kōra” — it’s kind of a modern wellness café but not too “hippie”, more clean and calm. We sell specialty coffee, herbal drinks, and light food. We want it to feel premium but still friendly, not luxury-luxury.

We don’t have a logo yet. We’d like something simple, maybe a symbol we can also use on cups and social media. Colors-wise, we like earthy tones but not brown-heavy. Maybe green? Or beige? We’re open.

We’ll need stuff for Instagram for sure — posts, stories, profile pic, that kind of thing. Also business cards because we’ll meet suppliers. If possible, something we can reuse easily.

Fonts: nothing too playful, but also not super corporate. Clean, modern, readable.

We also want some kind of document that explains how to use the logo and colors so later we don’t mess it up when printing menus or posting online.

Our website isn’t built yet, but it would be great if the branding works well on web too. A favicon would be nice.

Timeline is flexible but ideally within a month. Budget is mid-range, not huge but we want quality. We trust your creative direction.

Let us know what you think makes sense to include — we’re not designers so feel free to guide us.

Thanks!
