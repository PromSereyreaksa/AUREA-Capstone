Home office costs (electricity, AC) estimated at $40/month for 20 hours/week usage in Phnom Penh. Factory Phnom Penh offers monthly plans around $100-150, but for a junior designer with 20 hrs/week, selective day passes offer more flexibility and cost-efficiency. This estimate favors a more budget-conscious approach for a junior. Shared office rentals are typically higher per month. Cafe working costs are variable but often lower than dedicated co-working.",

For a junior designer prioritizing cost, potentially a well-maintained used laptop could be considered. This amortized cost is allocated to the operational expenses.",

Junior employed graphic designers in Cambodia typically earn between $300-$500/month. Freelancers need to account for benefits, taxes, and inconsistent income, thus aiming for at least 20-30% more than employed counterparts for a basic living.

Platforms like Upwork and Fiverr show Cambodian designers often starting around $5-$8/hour. Agencies may charge clients $20-$40/hour for junior designer work, but that includes overhead. For logo design, hourly rates can fluctuate, but project-based pricing is common, potentially ranging from $50-$150 for a junior. Social media graphics are often priced per package or per graphic, with juniors charging $5-$15 per graphic. The recommended rate sits within the mid to upper-mid range for a junior, reflecting growing demand for quality design."

However, for comprehensive branding and print work, the All Apps plan is more suitable. While Adobe doesn't explicitly list regional pricing for Cambodia, standard international pricing for individuals is $54.99/month. Figma Professional is $12/editor/month, but for a single designer, the free tier is sufficient unless collaborating extensively. Canva Pro is approximately $13/month. Assuming the All Apps plan for Adobe is the primary cost, with potential supplemental use of free/lower-tier tools, a monthly estimate of $50 is a reasonable mid-point for essential software. No student discounts readily advertised for Cambodia, and freelancer programs are often tied to specific regions.",

A home office requires significant electricity and AC usage. For a 30-hour work week (approx. 120 hours/month), with AC running 4-5 hours/day, electricity costs could be around $50-$100+. Shared office rentals are typically higher. Cafes are not ideal for consistent, professional work and can incur costs through purchases. $100/month is a reasonable average for a co-working space or a managed home office expense.",

Freelancers typically need to earn 20-30% more to account for benefits, taxes, and periods without work.

Agencies might charge $25-$50+ per hour to clients. Branding and print design are specialized skills, allowing for rates on the higher end of this spectrum, especially for startups with a good understanding of brand value. International platforms can offer higher rates, but competition from designers in lower-cost countries is also a factor. Positioning around $15-$20/hour for mid-level work is competitive and reflects the specialization."
